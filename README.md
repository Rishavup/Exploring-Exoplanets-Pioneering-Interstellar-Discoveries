# Exploring-Exoplanets-and-Pioneering-Interstellar-Discoveries

But what are Exoplanets?
Exoplanets are planets beyond our own solar system. Thousands have been discovered in the past two decades, mostly with NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope. These exoplanets come in a huge 
variety of sizes and orbits. Some are gigantic planets hugging close to their parent stars; others are icy, some rocky. NASA and other agencies are looking for a special kind of 
planet: one that’s the same size as Earth, orbiting a sun-like star in the habitable zone.

# Objective:
The major Objective of the Project is to predict the existence of Exoplanets using the readings of Intensity of Light (aka FLUX) of several stars over time.

# Learnings & future plan :

1) Confirmation of Exoplanet Existence confirmation that exoplanets are common in the universe.
2) Diversity of Exoplanets based on the flux change we could say that exoplanets come in variety of sizes
3) Astrobiology expanded the field of astrobiology, exploring the conditions required for life to exist beyond Earth
4) Astronomical research and exploration to detect potential habitability of other worlds beyond our own solar system based upon 3 factors (size of the planet,Temperature on the planet
and presence of water.)
